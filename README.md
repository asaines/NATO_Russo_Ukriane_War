# NATO-Russo-Ukraine War Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the NATO-Russo-Ukraine conflict, focusing on key events, military actions, and geopolitical implications. The analysis was performed using R and is presented as a markdown file, providing an alternative to traditional Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Overview

The project aims to explore the dynamics of the conflict through data-driven insights. It includes comprehensive visualizations, trend analyses, and discussions on the implications of the ongoing war.

## Structure

- **Analysis**: The core analysis is presented in markdown format [here](https://asaines.github.io/NATO_Russo_Ukriane_War/), generated using R. The analysis includes:
  - Key events timeline
  - Military actions and outcomes
  - Geopolitical and economic impacts
- **Data**: Raw and processed data used for the analysis is available in the `data` folder.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for data processing and visualization are located in the `scripts` folder.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary R packages (listed in the `DESCRIPTION` or `renv.lock` files).
3. Run the R markdown file to generate the analysis.

## Results

The analysis confirmed a significant finding: there is a negative relationship between the distance from Russia and the proportion of positive tweets about NATO. Specifically, the closer a European country is to Russia, the more positively it tweets about NATO. This conclusion was supported by the scatter plot, correlation matrix, and Europe heat map, validating the hypothesis that proximity to Russia influences public sentiment toward NATO.
